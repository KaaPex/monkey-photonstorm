Flixel Power Tools for Monkey
=================

This is a port of Flixel Power Tools to the [Monkey](http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz/) language.

The port is translated from [Flixel Power Tools](http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools) Version 1.9 

Quite frankly flixel is awesome. It allows for very rapid game development. And while it does a lot for you, it is lacking in a few  areas. After all it's just a framework, and frameworks are meant to be built-upon.

That is where the Flixel Power Tools come in. They are a set of classes, all neatly arranged in a single package that use the new plugin architecture of Flixel 2.5. They push flixel just that bit further and cover a lot of fundamental ground for you. The Flixel Power Tools are for Flixel 2.5+ only, they will not work with earlier versions.
